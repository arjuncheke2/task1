1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP 1.1                                      HTTP2
1.it usest works on the textual format       1.it works on the binary protocol
2.it compress data by itself.                2.it uses HPACK for data compression.
3.There is head of line blocking that        3.It allows multiplexing so one TCP 
  blocks all the requests behind it            connection is required for multiple request.
  until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources
4.It uses requests resource Inlining for     4.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects
use getting multiple pages                    all multiple pages.
5. it is a standard protocol                 5.a protocol for greater performance
6.loads resources one after the other,       6. it is able to use a single TCP connection
so if one resource cannot be loaded, it      to send multiple streams of data at once so that
blocks all the other resources behind it      no one resource blocks any other resource.


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Object :: In js,an object is a standalone entity,with properties and type.

 we can create objects by two methods in js:
 1.By object literal 
 2.using new keyword/by creating instances of object directly

 by object literal ::
 syntax=object={key:value....}
key and value is separated by colon(:)

by creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
 var objectName=new Object();

 here we are using new keyword to create an object.
